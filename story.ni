The player is in the Grand Central Coin Lockers.

[COIN LOCKERS]
The Grand Central Coin Lockers is a room. "I stand in front of the coin locker and take off my watch, placing it inside. I quickly run my hands through my pockets. My fingers briefly grasp the pager, holding it tight like it's a talisman.  I immediately feel stupid, but there's something oddly comforting about the feeling of the hard grey plastic against my fingers, as though it's tethering me to this world. Well, I have been accused of sentimentalism on more than one occasion. I should probably stick it in the locker, too; it's not like it's going to work over there anyhow. I place it in the coin locker and run my hands through the rest of my pockets, searching their contents.[paragraph break]North of here I can see the Main Concourse.[if the Jessamine-Number is known]I know her number:[digits of the Jessamine-Number]"

Instead of inserting the wallet into the coin locker:
	say "I'll probably need my wallet."

Instead of inserting the cash into the coin locker:
	say "No sense in leaving it here, it might come in handy."

[GRAND CENTRAL MAIN CONCOURSE]
The Grand Central Terminal Main Concourse is north of the Grand Central Coin Lockers. "The conversations of travelers bounce and echo indistinctly off the vaulted ceiling far overhead. Every surface seems to be made from the same peach-colored marble. Several large American flags adorn the walls, which are ringed with Christmas wreaths every few feet. In the center of the room is a large, four-faced clock, surrounded by ticket agents at a sort of open box office."

The American flag is scenery in the Grand Central Terminal Main Concourse. The description of the American flag is "'Old Glory,' as they say."
Understand "flag" as American flag.

[TRAIN PLATFORM]
The Train Platform is east of the Grand Central Main Concourse. "I walk down a dingy set of stairs and turn a corner to see the underground train platform stretching out in front of me, apparently deserted. Overhead lamps create pools of light every few feet extending into the darkness, giving the eerie impression that the strip of concrete extends out into eternity. To my right, a rather opulent looking train stands, doors open to boarding passengers. The left track is empty, and just over several sets of rails I can just barely make out the words 'Grand Central' spelled out in tile mosaic through the dim light.[paragraph break]I nearly give a start when I realize a man is standing barely three feet away from me, next to the open train door."

The Steam_Train is scenery in the Train Platform with the description "I don't really know much about trains, but this thing looks pretty old.". The printed name of the Steam_Train is "Train."

The Atrium is a room. "I walk through the entrance into a high-ceilinged atrium, reminding me of Grand Central in its old-world opulence, though the walls and fountain are all made from much darker stone. Beats me what the floor's made of, either polished stone or dark, lacquered wood. It reflects the lights above it, giving me the impression of walking on the surface of water. A security guard sits at a desk, idly reading a newspaper. He looks up as he hears my approach, about to give me whatever search he gives to every visitor. Upon seeing me, recognition dawns on his face, and he gives me a polite smile and gestures to a door behind him, saying, 'Go on in, Mr. Flint.'"

The Alley is a room. The Alley is in the outdoors. "A narrow alley off a cobblestone street."
In the Alley is a woman called Jessamine. The initial appearance of Jessamine is "A woman stands here, her gaze following me from the moment I turn the corner. She smiles warmly in recognition as I approach.[paragraph break]'Hello, Jess,' I say gruffly, in my best impression of a devil-may-care private dick."
[How'd you know I was in town? A litlte bird told me]
Jessamine is carrying the wrapped parcel. Jessamine is payable and unpaid. Understand "Jess" and "Jessie" as Jessamine.

Instead of giving the cash to Jessamine when Jessamine is unpaid:

Instead of giving the cash to Jessamine when Jessamine is paid:
		say "Jessamine shakes her head and says, 'Oh, I couldn't accept that much.'"


Chip Shop is a room. "A proper chip shop with simple wooden benches and utilitarian beige tile walls. The four items that comprise the menu are handwritten on a blackboard over the register. The patina of scratches and light grime on all of the surfaces rivals my favorite greasy spoon on the Upper West Side. Judging by the smell coming from the deep fryers in the back, they still use lard.[paragraph break]All in all, a bit dodgy. Or as a tourist might say, 'authentic.' It's been about ten years since I last set foot in this place, and it hasn't changed a bit."
The chippy_menu is scenery in the Chip Shop. The printed name of the chippy_menu is "menu". The description of the chippy menu is "TODO". Understand "menu" as chippy_menu.
